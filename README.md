# KA-Editor-Extension
Toying around with some ideas to make the KA default editors better. 

Install as usual. Download the code and unzip. Go to chrome://extensions and turn on developer mode. Load unpacked and find your extension download folder.

Editor dimensions customizability coming soon!

Version history:

0.1.0 - Adds an Editor On/Off button where Delete, Settings, etc are to toggle the code editor on and off. Works for Processing and webpages environments, but project support may vary as not all projects are created responsively. 

0.2.0 - Adds hover and active styling to toggle button.
